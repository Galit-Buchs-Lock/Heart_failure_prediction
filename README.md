# Heart_failure_prediction
hear failure predictions based on a database downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

This project predicts the existence of heart disease, based on 11 11 data features in the data set.
For the prediction the following steps were taken:
* Data observation
* Taking care of outliers
* Feature manipulation
* Use of Random forest model for prediction, parameters set using grid search

Output:
* MSE
* Recall
* precision
* Confusion matrix
